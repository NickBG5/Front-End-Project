                   Gol D. Roger was known as the "Pirate King," the strongest and most infamous being to have sailed the Grand Line. 
                  The capture and execution of Roger by the World Government brought a change throughout the world. 
                  His last words before his death revealed the existence of the greatest treasure in the world, One Piece. 
                  It was this revelation that brought about the Grand Age of Pirates, men who dreamed of finding One Piece—which promises an unlimited amount of riches and fame—and quite possibly the pinnacle of glory and the title of the Pirate King.

                <em><b>Summary:</b></em>
                    The appearance of "quirks," newly discovered super powers, has been steadily increasing over the years, with 80 percent of humanity possessing various abilities from manipulation of elements to shapeshifting. 
                    This leaves the remainder of the world completely powerless, and Izuku Midoriya is one such individual.
                    Since he was a child, the ambitious middle schooler has wanted nothing more than to be a hero. Izuku's unfair fate leaves him admiring heroes and taking notes on them whenever he can. 
                    But it seems that his persistence has borne some fruit: Izuku meets the number one hero and his personal idol, All Might. All Might's quirk is a unique ability that can be inherited, and he has chosen Izuku to be his successor!
                    Enduring many months of grueling training, Izuku enrolls in UA High, a prestigious high school famous for its excellent hero training program, and this year's freshmen look especially promising. 
                    With his bizarre but talented classmates and the looming threat of a villainous organization, Izuku will soon learn what it really means to be a hero.
